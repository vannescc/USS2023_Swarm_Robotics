## Running the Project
### Connecting to the BBBlue
I connect to the BeagleBone Blue in 3 ways:
1. When the BBBlue is connected via micro USB the you can use the [cloud9](https://beagleboard.org/support/bone101) IDE. This is how I chose to program the BBBlue.
2. 
3. After you connect via USB. In a PuTTy window, select SSH as your connection type and type the IP address of your device (the default is 192.168.8.2).
